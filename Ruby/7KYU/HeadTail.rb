Your job is to implement these functions in your given language. Make sure it
doesn't edit the array; that would cause problems! Here's a cheat sheet:

| HEAD | <----------- TAIL ------------> |
[  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,  10]
| <----------- INIT ------------> | LAST |

head [x] = x
tail [x] = []
init [x] = []
last [x] = x

=end

# My Solution
def head(arr)
  arr[0]
end

def tail(arr)
  arr[1..-1]
end

def init(arr)
  arr[0..-2]
end

def last(arr)
  arr[-1]
end
