If you were born in the 80's you were probably a pre-teen when the Secret World
of Alex Mack first aired. I'll be honest, the young superhero was my first crush

Typical superhero story: get slimed by radioactive gunk, obtain super powers,
struggle to learn more about your powers while uncovering the truth about
yourself, and most importantly, keep your identity a secret.

Top executives at Paradise Valley Chemical Plant are close to finding the
superhero's true identity. They know that someone who works at the plant is
related to her (Shhh, it's her dad!). Danielle Atron has hired you to obtain
the badge number of this person.

Can you find the Secret badge number of Alex Mack's dad?

Note: This is a puzzle. The initial solution is intentionally vague. Good luck!
